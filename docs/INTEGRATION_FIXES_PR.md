# 🔧 Critical Integration Fixes - Smart City CMS

## Summary

This PR contains critical fixes for authentication infinite loops and integration issues identified in the comprehensive code audit. These fixes resolve system-breaking issues and improve overall stability.

## 🚨 Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Authentication Infinite Redirect Loop ✅

- **Files Changed:** `client/store/api/baseApi.ts`
- **Issue:** Missing imports caused undefined function calls in auth handling
- **Fix:** Added proper imports for `logout`, `setError`, and `toast` functions
- **Impact:** Resolves complete authentication system failure

### 2. Enhanced Base Query Implementation ✅

- **Files Changed:** `client/store/api/baseApi.ts`
- **Issue:** App was using basic query instead of enhanced version with error handling
- **Fix:** Switched to `baseQueryWithReauth` for proper 401 handling and token refresh
- **Impact:** Improved error handling and automatic logout on expired tokens

### 3. Missing Utility Functions ✅

- **Files Added:** `client/lib/dateUtils.ts`, `client/lib/complaintUtils.ts`
- **Issue:** Components referenced undefined utility functions
- **Fix:** Created comprehensive utility libraries for date formatting and complaint status handling
- **Impact:** Eliminates runtime errors in dashboard components

### 4. File Upload Endpoint Compatibility ✅

- **Files Changed:** `server/routes/complaintRoutes.js`
- **Issue:** Frontend expects `/complaints/:id/attachments` but backend provides `/uploads/complaint/:id/attachment`
- **Fix:** Added route alias to maintain backward compatibility
- **Impact:** File uploads now work seamlessly from frontend

### 5. Missing Test Dependencies ✅

- **Dependencies Added:** `jsdom`, `@vitest/ui`, `msw`, `@testing-library/dom`
- **Issue:** Test suite completely broken due to missing dependencies
- **Fix:** Installed all required testing dependencies
- **Impact:** Test suite is now functional and can be executed

## 📊 Integration Health Improvement

## 🔒 Security Considerations

### Authentication Security

- ✅ Enhanced error handling prevents token leakage
- ✅ Proper logout on 401 responses
- ✅ No security regressions introduced

### API Security

- ✅ File upload endpoint maintains existing security middleware
- ✅ No new attack vectors introduced
- ✅ Backward compatibility doesn't compromise security

## 📋 Migration Guide

### For Developers

1. Pull latest changes
2. Run `npm install` to get new dependencies
3. Test auth flow to verify fixes
4. Run test suite with `npm run test`

### For Deployment

- ✅ No database migrations required
- ✅ No environment variable changes needed
- ✅ Backward compatible changes only

## 🔄 Future Improvements

### Short Term (Next Sprint)

1. Migrate remaining components to RTK Query for consistency
